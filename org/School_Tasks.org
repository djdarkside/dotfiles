Review, review, review!  This first week is mainly a whirlwind review of precalculus and algebra concepts and strategies, 
to make sure you remember your Encyclopedia of Functions.  Having this stuff solid will make the rest of the class go much smoother.  
Don't worry; I'll still be teasing some more calculus concepts this week, too!

Study Transformations and what different graphs of functions look like.
Be able to identify what a graph function is.
